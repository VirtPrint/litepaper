# VirtPrint Litepaper

## Introduction
VirtPrint is a community-driven cryptocurrency token designed to reward its holders through a reflection mechanism. The token operates on a 5% tax on every buy and sell transaction, with rewards distributed to holders in the form of VIRTUAL tokens. In addition, a portion of the total supply has been burned to reduce the circulating supply and create scarcity.

## Key Features

- **Reflection Mechanism**: VirtPrint has a 5% tax on every buy and sell transaction. The tax collected is redistributed among holders of VirtPrint tokens in the form of VIRTUAL tokens. The more VirtPrint you hold, the larger your share of the tax reward pool.

- **Burn Mechanism**: 40% of the total supply has been burned, reducing the total circulating supply. This helps increase the scarcity of VirtPrint tokens and potentially increases the value of the remaining supply over time.

- **Reward Distribution**: The 5% tax collected from each transaction is redistributed to holders of VirtPrint based on the proportion of the total circulating supply they own. For example, if you hold 5% of the circulating supply, you will receive 5% of the total rewards.

## How Reflections Work

- **Tax Collection**: Every buy and sell transaction of VirtPrint incurs a 5% tax. This tax is collected from all transactions within a given period.
- **Proportional Rewards**: The collected tax is then distributed among VirtPrint holders based on their share of the total circulating supply.
- **VIRTUAL Tokens**: The reward for each holder is distributed as VIRTUAL tokens, which can either be sold or accumulated as rewards over time.

## Example

- **Your Holdings**: If you hold 1,000,000 VirtPrint tokens and the total circulating supply is 600,000,000 tokens (after the burn), your share of the circulating supply is approximately 0.17%.
- **Transaction Volume**: Let’s assume that $9,500 in buy and sell transactions happens in a 24-hour period.
- **Tax Collected**: The 5% tax collected from the transactions would be $475.
- **Reflection Rewards**: Since you hold 0.17% of the total circulating supply, your share of the $475 tax would be $0.81 worth of VIRTUAL tokens.

## Burn Mechanism
40% of the total supply of VirtPrint tokens has been burned. This reduction in the circulating supply aims to create scarcity, which could increase the value of the remaining tokens over time.

## Market Dynamics
The VIRTUAL token rewards are directly tied to transaction volume. As the market cap and transaction volume increase, the tax pool grows, meaning more VIRTUAL tokens are distributed to holders. Therefore, an increase in transaction activity and market cap will lead to higher rewards for VirtPrint holders.

## Presale and Launch Details
VirtPrint is currently in the presale phase. Once the presale reaches its cap, the official token launch will take place, and VIRTUAL token rewards will begin to be distributed to holders based on the transaction volume and tax collection.
